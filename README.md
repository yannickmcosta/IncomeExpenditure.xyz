# IncomeExpenditure.xyz
A website made in minutes for filling out Income and Expenditure Financial Statements, born out of a requirement for a family member to fill in a form emailed to them (from a council...) with no editable regions.

Welcome, this has been created by Yannick McCabe-Costa to assist people who have limited access to technology, or who have received an email similar to one a family member received from Cheshire Home Choice (Cheshire East Council) with a "form" that needs filling out. Of course, it's not an interactive form, HEAVEN FORBID. It's a f**king email table, with no editable regions, but my god if you don't fill it out there will be hell to pay.

So no need to go grab your pen and tip-ex and start scribbling all over your computer screen, this is 2019, and this lovely thing called i n t e r a c t i v e dynamic pages exist, don't they Cheshire East? Useless...

Anyway, you are more than welcome to use this as much as you like, but it's provided without warranty, like any good piece of open source software.
