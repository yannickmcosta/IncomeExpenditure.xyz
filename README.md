# IncomeExpenditure.xyz
A website made in minutes for filling out Income and Expenditure Financial Statements, born out of a requirement for a family member to fill in a form emailed to them with no editable regions.

Welcome, this has been created by Yannick McCabe-Costa to assist people who have limited access to technology, or who have received an email similar to one a family member received from Cheshire Home Choice (Cheshire East Council) with a "form" that needs filling out. Unfortunately, this form consisted of un-editable regions in an email, and there was no PDF attachment. So an itch needed scratching.

You are more than welcome to use this as much as you like, but it's provided without warranty, like any good piece of open source software.
